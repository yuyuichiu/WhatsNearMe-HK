<< data attributes >>
    In HTML, tags can have its data attribute to store additional data
    For example, if there are many clickable student buttons, data attributes can store their SID

    The data attribute itself will not do anything, but javaScript can assess it
    By "var.dataset.customName", the data written in it can be retrieved

    Example:
    HTML:  <div class="places" data-query="public library">圖書館</div>
    JavaScript:  element.dataset.query ==> "public library"
    CSS: content: attr(data-query);
